# alienInvasion
# Background:

Alien invasion is a click based shooting game. The city is being overrun by an alien invasion. The player will be ambushed by aliens armed with lasers. Aliens will randomly generate on the screen, after a brief delay, the randomly generated alien will shoot a laser at the player. The player must shoot the alien before being shot by the laser. A single shot will neutralize the alien. The player will lose health each time an alien lands a successful laser shot. 

Random bystanders will also be generated on the screen. If the player shoots a bystander, they will automatically lose the game. The player will also lose if they run out of health. After a successful level completion, the next level will proceed and more aliens will generate. The time between generation and laser shot will also decrease. Therefore, the next level will be harder.
